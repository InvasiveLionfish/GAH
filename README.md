The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the popular party card game, Cards Against Humanity.
We recommend playing with four players.

##Instructions

###Gameplay
* 1. You win the game by having the most points after 7 rounds. 
* 2. Rounds consist of one prompt, and multiple selected Gifs submitted by the players in response to that prompt.
* 3. Each round is played by one judge and multiple players.
* 4. The players make their selections; the judge after viewing all submisisons selects a winner who recieves one point.
